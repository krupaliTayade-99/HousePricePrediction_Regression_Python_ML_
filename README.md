A hands-on trial miniproject performed during pursuing online ML training and internship winter program (Dec 2019)
Using Matplot Libraries- for Y and X plot of the data used to understand the scatter for future predictions, data visualizations.

Also, used Pandas for data cleaning, transformation and analysis.
